The City of Odaria was the centre of the Odarian 
Kingdom.It housed the monarchy. The first ruler was 
King Loras the first of House Berken. The monarchy 
ruled for over half a millenia until under the rule 
of King Stefon the third of House Berken the city 
suffered its demise.

It was under Stefons rule that his royal advisers 
grew hungry for power each one willing to stab the 
other in the back for a chance to climb up to the 
next rung on the ladder. With the leaders of the 
city turning on eachother it wasn't long before the 
civillians began choosing sides. When Stefon was 
made aware of what was taking place within his 
kingdom it was already too late. What followed was 
out of his hands civil war after civil war deepened 
the divide within the City of Odaria.

<text>
The countless wars bled the city's wealth and 
supplies dry to the point that it could no longer 
sustain itself. The people grew tired of the mess 
they were in and passed the blame to King Stefon. 
They had him executed. Not long after the beings of 
magic left the city fleeing back to the realm of 
magic.

The Great War took place when the people turned on 
the leaders. So many people died that th few who
survived fled to the other regions. The City of 
Odaria eventually collapsed, with the centre of the 
kingdom gone Kingdom of Odaria eroded away from 
within. The kingdoms broke up and began to take care 
of themselves whilst Odaria was left behind in the 
past.

It turns out that Roswell was behind the fall of 
Odaria he had planned to takeover the kingdom for 
himself. However he realised that on his own he 
wouldnt be able to overpower the King of the other 
advisers. He took his time manipulating each of the 
advisers turning them on one another. As the closest 
adviser to the King he chose to wait before he 
informed Stefon that advisers had turned and the 
people were divided. This was to help ensure that it 
was too late to be fixed. Roswell then began to
convince the people that the source of their problem 
was King Stefon. Once he was executed Roswell needed 
to ensure that he would go unchallenged and so he 
sought to take out all the beings who possessed magic. 
He began killing them off and sealed of the portal to 
the Realm of Magic.

Only a few beings that possessed 
the ability of magic survived such as the City 
Guardians, King Luther and Roswell himself. Everything 
was going to his plan until the Great War took place 
it destroyed the city and killed the majority of the 
population. Roswell left Odaria using the two prince 
to fulfil his plan. He came back to the ruins of 
Odaria with the intention to rebuild the city for his 
own.

<name> City of Odaria
<text>
The City of Odaria is the centre piece of the
Realm of Odaria. Once a glorius city, now in 
its place lies a ruin, a reminder of the past 
events that once took place here. The City of 
Odaria isnt ruled by anyone as theres no need to, 
no one lives here. The city had all the elements 
of the other kingdoms which helped make it the 
wonder it was. The magical beigns that roamed 
here havent been seen since the fall of Odaria.
